# TIET-SummerSchool-2025

> üåü My Journey through the TIET Machine Learning & Deep Learning Summer School 2025

Welcome to my official repository, documenting the hands-on learning and projects completed as **Samarth Mahajan**, 3rd-year Computer Engineering student at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala. This central hub serves as a curated showcase of my work and reflections from the summer school, which was guided by the motto: **Learning by Doing**.
